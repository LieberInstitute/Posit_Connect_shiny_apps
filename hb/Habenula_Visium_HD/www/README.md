Welcome to the Habenula Atlas project! Here you will find all code used
to analyze the data generated as part of our manuscript, which is
currently preprinted [here](https://doi.org/10.64898/2026.09.30.755667).

In this project we studied spatially resolved transcriptomics and
single-nucleus multiomic (ATAC + RNA) data from the habenula of
postmortem human brain samples from a total of 13 neurotypical controls.
We generated data from multiple assays:

- [10x Genomics
  **Visium**](https://www.10xgenomics.com/products/spatial-gene-expression)
- [10x Genomics **Chromium** (snATAC +
  snRNA-seq)](https://www.10xgenomics.com/platforms/chromium/product-family)
- [10x Genomics **Visium
  HD**](https://www.10xgenomics.com/products/hd-wt-panel-gene-expression)

This work was a joint effort by the [Keri
Martinowich](https://www.libd.org/team/keri-martinowich-phd/), [Leonardo
Collado-Torres](http://lcolladotor.github.io/), and [Kristen
Maynard](https://www.libd.org/team/kristen-maynard-phd/) teams at the
[Lieber Institute for Brain Development](https://www.libd.org) as well
as [Brion
Maher](https://publichealth.jhu.edu/faculty/2471/brion-maher)’s group
from [JHBSPH’s Mental Health
Department](https://publichealth.jhu.edu/departments/mental-health).

There are 2 GitHub repos associated with this study. They are:

## This App

This app explores the 5 donors (10 samples) for which Visium HD was performed.
It allows viewing of gene expression, spatial clusters, cell types, and more,
overlayed with the H&E image captured for each sample.

All samples are oriented with dorsal up (ventral down) and medial left 
(lateral right). Sample IDs include the donor ID (e.g. Br9090) and the tissue
section (1 or 2), since for each of the five donors two spatially adjacent
replicates were taken.

**Multi-omic mapping of the human Hb**. (**A**) A schematic showing the
cutting scheme to allow for smFISH/RNAscope, VisiumHD, and snMultiome.
The Hb was scored out to minimize thalamic contamination (N=12). (**B**)
snMultiome schematic showing that the assay allows for profiling of both
the transcriptome and epigenome from the same nuclei (n=10). (**C**)
VisiumHD schematic showcasing the subcellular resolution that can be
achieved using this spatial transcriptomic technique (n=5). (**D**) A
visual representation of the biological questions this study sought to
answer. (**D.a.**) Cross talk between the medial and lateral portions of
the Hb. (**D.b.**) Transcription factors and which genes are impacted
(**D.c.**) Which cell types are at highest risk in disease states.
(**D.d.**) Locating inhibitory neurons within the Hb, particularly in
the LHb. (**D.e.**) Cell-to-cell communication within the Hb. (**D.f.**)
Cell type distribution in the Hb. (**D.g.**) Neuron-glia interactions in
the Hb. (**E**) Brain slab illustration that depicts the landmark
structures used during dissection (C - caudate, SP - segmented putamen,
LGN - lateral geniculate nucleus, SN - substantial nigra, Th - thalamus)
and the location of the LHb and MHb and an approximation of the brain
blocks that were dissected out. Medial (M), dorsal (D), and anterior (A)
directions are shown by the respective arrows. (**F**) A brain block
that contained Hb, confirmed by RNAscope. (**F.a.**) Brain block with
the Hb demarcated in a red dashed line. (**F.b-e.**) Single channel
images of the probe panel used to locate the Hb, TAC3, GPR151, POU4F1,
and MBP were used together to identify, generally the Hb (POU4F1) , the
MHb (TAC3), LHb (GPR151), and the surrounding white matter (MBP). In
(F.e.) the boundaries of the MHb and LHb are drawn. The insets for
(E.b-e.) are zoom-ins of the body of the Hb. (**G**) VisiumHD of the
same donor shown in E. (**G.a.**) The small image to the left shows the
whole 6x6 mm array, with the dashed line showing the section that is
shown at a larger scale to the right. The right image in (G.a.) is the
eosin staining that was completed during VisiumHD with boundaries of the
MHb and LHb that were also in (F.e.). (**G.b-e.**) VisiumHD expression
for the same marker genes that were used to confirm the presence of Hb
via RNAscope in (E.b-e.). (**H**) A UMAP of the gene expression/RNA data
achieved from snMultiome. (**I**) A UMAP of the ATAC data from
snMultiome. (**J**) A UMAP of the integrated RNA and ATAC clusters.
(**K**) Broad marker genes for the clusters yielded, where the intensity
of the color and size of the spot denote the expression of the
respective gene.

## Interactive Websites

All of these interactive websites are powered by open source software,
namely:

- 🔭 [`spatialLIBD`](https://doi.org/10.1186/s12864-022-08601-w)
- 👀 [`iSEE`](https://doi.org/10.12688%2Ff1000research.14966.1)
- 🔍 [`R/Shiny`](https://shiny.posit.co/)

We provide the following interactive websites, organized by dataset with
software labeled by emojis:

- 🔍 [snMultiome](https://interactive.libd.org/Habenula_multiome/). Here
  you can explore the cell-level multiome data, visualize
  peak-gene-transcription-factor trios computed with a metacell-level
  object (metacells and trios computed by `TRIPOD`), and view
  differentially accessible regions (DARs) computed from the snATAC-seq
  data.
- 🔭 [Visium H&E](https://interactive.libd.org/Habenula_Visium/). Here
  you can explore the spot-level Visium data, as well as view markers +
  enrichment statistics for data pseudobulked by preliminary `k = 9`
  clusters computed with `PRECAST`.
- 👀 [Visium HD pseudobulked by cell
  type](https://interactive.libd.org/Habenula_Visium_HD_pb/). This app
  is better suited for quickly exploring how genes globally vary across
  cell types from the manuscript.
- 🔭 [Visium HD:
  cell-level](https://interactive.libd.org/Habenula_Visium_HD_Shiny/).
  This app allows you to spatially explore the cell-level Visium HD data
  including clusters + cell types, QC variables, and more.

## Data Access

The Zenodo Archive for this project can be found
[here](https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.23019505). Project data was also
uploaded to the [NeMO](https://nemoarchive.org/) and can be found here
(TODO).

The major R objects for each analysis are also available through
`spatialLIBD::fetch_data()` as of `spatialLIBD` version `1.25.5`. We
provide access to the following R objects, named by the `type` argument
provided to `spatialLIBD::fetch_data()`:

- **`habenula_atlas_HD_spe_cell`**: The Visium HD cell-level data as a
  `SpatialExperiment`.
- **`habenula_atlas_HD_spe_cell_pseudobulk`**: The same data
  pseudobulked by cell type.
- **`habenula_atlas_visium_spe`**: The Visium H&E spot-level data as a
  `SpatialExperiment`.
- **`habenula_atlas_visium_spe_pseudobulk`**: The same data pseudobulked
  by `k = 9` cluster.
- **`habenula_atlas_snMultiome_seurat_cell`**: The snMultiome cell-level
  data as a `Seurat` object.
- **`habenula_atlas_snMultiome_seurat_metacell`**: The snMultiome
  metacell-level data as a `Seurat` object.

For example, let’s check out the Visium HD cell-level data:
